# Peru Unemployment EDA ðŸ“ˆ

The unemployment rate is crucial for assessing the economic health of a country, as it shows how the labor market generates employment and absorbs the labor force. However, in our country, its understanding is limited, making it difficult to create effective solutions to unemployment, especially in Lima's most vulnerable groups. Improving the analysis and dissemination of this indicator will allow for the development of more informed and effective policies, promoting an inclusive and equitable labor market.
